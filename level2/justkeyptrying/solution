name of challenge: just keyp trying
this was a usb packet capture. open it up in wireshark and see the data
However, usb protocol has 0x04 mapped to A, 0x05=B, and so on 
(per the usb protocol guide above)

what kind of data is in the capture? by the title, i'm guessing keyboard.
data in the capture point towards that conclusion too, since keyboards
issue interrupts for every keystroke.

per usb protocol:
data in each frame (each keystroke) separated by 102 bytes, with the 
first byte 0x09 == "F" starting at 0x45.

write a python script to open the pcap file as a binary file, and read
in indices of file

submit the flag with proper format
