i had a feeling that file was a zip archive, and i was right

however, flag.png could not be extracted due to corrupt headers

i tried using foremost and looked online for a bunch of stuff to "fix"
the zip archive for me... to no success.

error message for unzip was corrupted headers: looking at the first
few bytes of the file was a dead giveaway

first few bytes (magic number/header) of file
	XXXXXX instead of PKZIP 

using a hexeditor i patched out the first few bytes to the correct
header and tried to unzip it, and then was able to successfully view
the flag file
