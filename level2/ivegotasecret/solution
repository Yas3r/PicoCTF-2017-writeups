format string vulnerability

printf(buffer)
enter in a bunch of %p's to leak the contents of the stack

run program twice and compare stack contents. since ASLR is off, the 
stack contents should be the same every time, with the exception of
the secret that we read in from /dev/urandom/.

copy and paste the differing dword (4 bytes) and submit to get flag!
