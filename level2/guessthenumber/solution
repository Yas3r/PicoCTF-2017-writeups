no shellcode needed, just the address of function to jump to

win is at 0x804852b
input gets right shifted over by 4 bits (half a byte), so to
compensate, we left shift our input by 4 bits

input: 0x804852b0 == 2152223408

this is larger than MAX_INT == 2147483647. however, binary
representation of 2152223408 (unsigned) is equivalent to the binary
represenation of -2142743888 in two's complement.

enter in -2142743888 and get our shell.
