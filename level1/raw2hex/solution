run program, store output in file

	$ ./raw2hex > ~/raw2hex/output

remove the first few bytes of the output file "The flag is:"

the rest of the bytes are the flag (except for newline and null byte)

using python to translate the bytes for you:

	import binascii
	
	text = ""
	with open("output", "r") as f:
		text = f.read()

	# text[12:] contains the flag

	flag = text[12:]
	print binascii.hexlify(flag)
